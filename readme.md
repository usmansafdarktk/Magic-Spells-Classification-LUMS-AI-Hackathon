Random Forest Model Training and Prediction with GUI

This project implements a Random Forest-based machine learning pipeline for training, evaluating, and predicting using coordinate data from CSV files. It includes a GUI application for predicting labels of individual files.

Features

Data Loading:

Reads data from CSV files organized in folders where each folder represents a class label.

Data Preprocessing:

Normalizes and transforms coordinate data into features like relative movements, speed, and angles.

Feature Extraction:

Calculates statistical features (mean, standard deviation) for predictive modeling.

Model Training:

Trains a Random Forest classifier on the processed and extracted features.

Model Saving:

Saves the trained model, label encoder, and scaler for later use.

Prediction:

Provides a Python script to predict the class label of a single CSV file.

Includes a GUI software for user-friendly predictions.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Train the Model

Prepare the Data:

Place your CSV files inside the All Data directory, organized by class labels (folder names).

Run the Training Script:

python train_model.py

This will train the Random Forest model and save it along with the label encoder and scaler in the rf_all_data_model_files directory.

How to Predict a Single File

Run the Prediction Script:

Use the predict_file.py script to predict the label of a single CSV file.

python predict_file.py --file_path path/to/your/file.csv

Output:

The script will output the predicted label.

GUI Prediction Application

Launch the GUI:

python gui_predictor.py

Steps in the GUI:

Select a CSV file using the "Browse" button.

Click "Predict" to see the class label.

The GUI uses the saved Random Forest model for prediction.

File Descriptions

train_model.py

Trains a Random Forest classifier using features extracted from coordinate data.

Saves the model, label encoder, and scaler for later predictions.

predict_file.py

Loads the saved model, scaler, and label encoder to predict the label of a single CSV file.

Processes and extracts features from the input file before prediction.

gui_predictor.py

A Tkinter-based graphical user interface for user-friendly predictions.

Allows users to select a file and view predictions interactively.

Dependencies

See requirements.txt for the full list of dependencies:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
opencv-python
Pillow
matplotlib
scipy
tk

Model Saving

The trained model and associated files are saved in the rf_all_data_model_files directory:

model.pkl: Trained Random Forest model

label_encoder.pkl: Label encoder for class labels

scaler.pkl: Scaler for feature normalization

Future Enhancements

Add support for additional features or alternative classifiers.

Improve the GUI with advanced functionalities like batch file predictions.
